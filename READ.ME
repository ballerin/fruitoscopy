To install the software on the Raspberry Pi you need to:

    $ sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy

    $ sudo pip install flask scikit-learn


Follow the guide on http://elinux.org/RPI-Wireless-Hotspot to configure the Raspberry Pi as Hotspot (point nÂ° 4 is not mandatory, since the raspberry server is made to work offline)

Clone the fruitoscopy repository (better in /home/pi/ )

    git clone {{ insert here repository }}


Add to the /etc/rc.local these lines before the " exit 0 "

    sudo ifconfig wlan0 192.168.42.1
    
    sudo service udhcpd stop
    
    sudo service udhcpd start
    
    python /home/pi/fruitoscopy/rasp_app/main.py


(You have to execute the main.py that you have cloned from the GitHub repository, if the path where you have cloned the repo is different, use yours)
